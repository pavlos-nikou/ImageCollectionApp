<h1>Wedding Photo Upload Web App</h1>

  <p>
    This project is a simple PHP-based web application designed to collect photos from wedding guests.
  </p>
  <p>
    Guests can upload images through a browser on their phone or device, and the uploaded photos are saved directly
    to a specific disk or folder on the computer running the server.
  </p>
  <p>
    The goal is to collect all wedding photos locally without relying on social media platforms or third-party cloud services.
